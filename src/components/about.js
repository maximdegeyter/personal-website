      I'm a 24 year old <strong>Devine</strong> (Digital design & development)
      alumni from <strong>Ghent, Belgium</strong>. Currently I'm looking for ðŸ”¥
    <strong> my first job</strong> ðŸ”¥ to kickstart my career. If I'm not busy
      programming or designing, then you'll probably find me near a comic book,
      something Star Wars related, or a basketball!
